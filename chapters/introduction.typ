Systems of mixed least and greatest fixpoint equations over complete lattices are a very common occurence in the field of formal analysis and particularly model checking. Some examples are:

- $mu$-calculus, where liveness and safety properties can be expressed using least and greatest fixpoints;
- bisimilarity, often defined as a greatest fixpoint;
- Łukasiewicz $mu$-calculus, a version of $mu$-calculus where
