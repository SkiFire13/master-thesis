== Systems of fixpoint equations

// TODO: Cite @baldan_upto ?
We will now define what is a system of fixpoint equations and what is its solution. Intuitiviely this will be very similar to a normal system of equations, except where each equation is changed to be a fixpoint equation. Since there can be more than one fixpoint we will also need to specify which kind of fixpoint the equation specifies, which we will do by using respectively the symbols $lfp$ and $gfp$ in subscript after the equal sign.

#definition("system of fixpoint equation")[
  Let $(L, sub)$ be a complete lattice. A system of fixpoint equations $E$ is a system of the following shape:

  $
    syseq(
      x_1 &feq_eta_1 &f_1 &(x_1, ..., x_n) \
      x_2 &feq_eta_2 &f_2 &(x_1, ..., x_n) \
          &#h(0.3em)dots.v \
      x_n &feq_eta_n &f_n &(x_1, ..., x_n) \
    )
  $

  For all $i in range(n)$, $x_i in L$ and $f_i : L^n -> L$ is a monotone function. $eta_i$ is either $mu$ or $nu$, representing either a least or a greatest fixpoint equation.
]

#notation("system of fixpoint equations as tuple")[
  The above system of fixpoint equations can be written as $tup(x) feq_tup(eta) tup(f)(tup(x))$, where:
  - $tup(x) = (x_1, ..., x_n)$;
  - $tup(f) = (f_1, ..., f_n)$ but also seen as $tup(f): L^n -> L^n$ with $tup(f)(x_1, ..., x_n) = (f_1(x_1), ..., f_n (x_n))$;
  - $tup(eta) = (eta_1, ..., eta_n)$.
]

// TODO: tup(f) monotone according to pointwise order? Is it useful?

#notation("empty system of fixpoint equations")[
  A system of equations with no equations or variables is conveniently written as $emptyset$.
]

#definition("substitution")[
  Let $(L, sub)$ be a complete lattice and $E$ be a system of $n$ fixpoint equations over $L$ and variables $x_i$ for $i in range(n)$. Let $j in range(n)$ and $l in L$. The substitution $E[x_j := l]$ is a new system of equation where the $j$-th equation is removed and any use of the variable $x_j$ is replaced with the element $l$.
]

We can now define the solution for a system of fixpoint equations recursively, starting from the last variable, which is replaced in the rest of the system by a free variable. That is solved and its solution, which is a function of the free variable, is used in a fixpoint equation to determine the solution for the last variable.

// TODO: Intuitively this could be seen as considering the lattice L^n of $n$-tuples ordered according to the pointwise extension of $sub$, and the monotone function $tup(f)$ over them. The fixpoints of this function will then form a lattice, but we are interested only in one of them. Starting from the $n$-th equation and going backward, we will iteratively restrict this lattice to only those elements where $x_i$ is the least or the greatest of all fixpoints, depending on whether the $i$-th equation is a least of greatest fixpoint. This step will fix that element of the solution, and repeating it for every equation will yield the final unique solution.

#definition("solution")[
  Let $(L, sub)$ be a complete lattice and $E$ be a system of $n$ fixpoint equations over $L$ and variables $x_i$ for $i in range(n)$. The solution of $E$ is $s = sol(E)$, with $s in L^n$ inductively defined as:

  $
    sol(emptyset) &= () \
    sol(E) &= (sol(E[x_n := s_n]), s_n)
  $

  where $s_n = eta_n (lambda x. f_n (sol(E[x_n := x]), x))$.
]

#example("solving a fixpoint system")[
  Consider the following system of fixpoint equations $E$ on some powerset $2^X$:
  $
    syseq(
      x_1 &feq_mu x_1 union x_2 \
      x_2 &feq_nu x_1 sect x_2 \ 
    )
  $
  Solving this system of equations will require the following steps:
  - $sol(E) = (sol(E[x_2 := s_2]), s_2)$ with $s_2 = nu(lambda x. sol(E[x_2 := x]) sect x)$
  - $sol(E[x_2 := x]) = (sol(emptyset), s_1)$ with $s_1 = mu(lambda x'. x' union x)$
  - solving $s_1$ gives $s_1 = x$
  - solving $s_2$ gives $s_2 = nu(lambda x. x sect x) = X$
  - $sol(E) = (X, X)$
]

Notice that the way the solution of a system of fixpoint equations is defined depends on the order of the equations. Indeed different orders can result in different solutions.

#example("different order of equations")[
  Consider $E'$ the same system of fixpoint equations as before, but with the equations swapped:
  $
    syseq(
      x_1 &feq_nu x_1 sect x_2 \
      x_2 &feq_mu x_1 union x_2 \
    )
  $
  Solving this system of equations will require the following steps:
  - $sol(E') = (sol(E'[x_2 := s_2]), s_2)$ with $s_2 = mu(lambda x. sol(E'[x_2 := x]) union x)$
  - $sol(E'[x_2 := x]) = (sol(emptyset), s_1)$ with $s_1 = nu(lambda x'. x' sect x)$
  - solving $s_1$ gives $s_1 = x$
  - solving $s_2$ gives $s_2 = mu(lambda x. x sect x) = emptyset$
  - $sol(E') = (emptyset, emptyset)$

  Notice that $sol(E) = (X, X) != (emptyset, emptyset) = sol(E')$
