= Background

In this chapter we give an overview of the theoretical background used in the rest of this thesis. We will first define what is a system of fixpoint equations and what is its solution, along with any concept needed for this. We will then give a brief introduction to parity games and how to efficiently characterize the solution of a system of fixpoint equations using a parity game. Finally we will introduce two algorithms used to solve parity games which we will be using later on.
